# Basic Tauri + Vue 3 Project
- There are two pages: Home and Search
#### Home Page
- A simple form that takes a name input
- A button that triggers a call to the Rust backend
- Display area for the response from the backend
- Theme toggle switcher
#### Search Page
- The component performs a search through an array of names stored in a separate Pinia store
- Search results are displayed in real-time. If no matches are found, the message "No results found." is shown
- Clear input button: A cross (Ã—) appears when the input field contains one or more characters, allowing users to clear the input
- Overlay interaction: When the search input is active, the rest of the interface is covered by an overlay
- Click-outside logic: The suggestions dropdown collapses when clicking outside the component. This logic is extracted into a reusable composable
- Theme switcher: Added a theme toggle (light/dark) based on CSS variables
